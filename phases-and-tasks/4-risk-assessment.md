# Phase 4: Risk Assessment

1. **Identify Risks:**
   * Brainstorm potential risks that could impact the feasibility of the project.
   * Risks could include technical challenges, resource constraints, scope creep, or changes in business priorities.
2. **Risk Analysis:**
   * Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk.
   * Classify risks as high, medium, or low based on their severity and probability.
   * Prioritize risks that need immediate attention and mitigation strategies.
