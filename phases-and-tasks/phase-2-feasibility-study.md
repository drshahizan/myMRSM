# Phase 2: Feasibility Study

1. **Technical Feasibility:**
   * Evaluate the current technology infrastructure, hardware, software, and network capabilities.
   * Determine if the proposed system can be effectively integrated into the existing technical environment.
   * Identify potential technical challenges, such as compatibility issues or system performance concerns.
2. **Operational Feasibility:**
   * Analyze the impact of the myMRSM system on current business processes, workflows, and staff roles.
   * Assess whether the proposed system aligns with the organization's operational goals and strategies.
   * Identify potential disruptions and develop plans to mitigate them during implementation.
3. **Financial Feasibility:**
   * Estimate the costs associated with system development, including software licenses, hardware, personnel, training, and ongoing maintenance.
   * Calculate the potential benefits and returns on investment (ROI) that the system can provide.
   * Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the project is financially viable and beneficial for the organization.
4. **Legal and Regulatory Feasibility:**
   * Identify relevant legal and regulatory requirements that the myMRSM system must adhere to.
   * Ensure compliance with data protection laws, privacy regulations, and industry standards.
   * Assess potential legal and regulatory risks and plan strategies to address them.
5. **Schedule Feasibility:**
   * Develop a project timeline that outlines the different phases, milestones, and deliverables of the feasibility study.
   * Consider factors such as resource availability, dependencies, and potential delays.
   * Set realistic expectations for the time required to complete the study and make informed decisions.
