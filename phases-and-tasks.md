   * Identify all parties involved in or affected by the project, including users, management, IT team, and external stakeholders.
   * Understand their needs, expectations, and concerns related to the myMRSM system.
   * Establish communication channels and methods to keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project.
3. **Resource Allocation:**
   * Allocate the necessary human resources, including project managers, analysts, developers, and testers.
   * Estimate the budget required for the feasibility study, considering expenses like tools, equipment, and third-party services.
   * Identify the technical infrastructure needed to support the study activities.
4. **Project Kick-off:**
   * Organize a project kick-off meeting to introduce the project team and stakeholders to the project's objectives, scope, and expectations.
   * Define roles and responsibilities for each team member.
   * Set the tone for collaboration, communication, and project governance.

**Phase 2: Feasibility Study**

1. **Technical Feasibility:**
   * Evaluate the current technology infrastructure, hardware, software, and network capabilities.
   * Determine if the proposed system can be effectively integrated into the existing technical environment.
   * Identify potential technical challenges, such as compatibility issues or system performance concerns.
2. **Operational Feasibility:**
   * Analyze the impact of the myMRSM system on current business processes, workflows, and staff roles.
   * Assess whether the proposed system aligns with the organization's operational goals and strategies.
   * Identify potential disruptions and develop plans to mitigate them during implementation.
3. **Financial Feasibility:**
   * Estimate the costs associated with system development, including software licenses, hardware, personnel, training, and ongoing maintenance.
   * Calculate the potential benefits and returns on investment (ROI) that the system can provide.
   * Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the project is financially viable and beneficial for the organization.
4. **Legal and Regulatory Feasibility:**
   * Identify relevant legal and regulatory requirements that the myMRSM system must adhere to.
   * Ensure compliance with data protection laws, privacy regulations, and industry standards.
   * Assess potential legal and regulatory risks and plan strategies to address them.
5. **Schedule Feasibility:**
   * Develop a project timeline that outlines the different phases, milestones, and deliverables of the feasibility study.
   * Consider factors such as resource availability, dependencies, and potential delays.
   * Set realistic expectations for the time required to complete the study and make informed decisions.

**Phase 3: Requirement Analysis**

1. **User Requirements Gathering:**
   * Engage with stakeholders, including end-users, to understand their needs, preferences, and expectations from the myMRSM system.
   * Conduct interviews, surveys, and workshops to gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **System Architecture Design:**
   * Design the high-level architecture of the myMRSM system, outlining the components, modules, and data flows.
   * Determine the database structure, user interfaces, integration points with other systems, and security measures.

**Phase 4: Risk Assessment**

1. **Identify Risks:**
   * Brainstorm potential risks that could impact the feasibility of the project.
   * Risks could include technical challenges, resource constraints, scope creep, or changes in business priorities.
2. **Risk Analysis:**
   * Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk.
   * Classify risks as high, medium, or low based on their severity and probability.
   * Prioritize risks that need immediate attention and mitigation strategies.

**Phase 5: Report Preparation**

1. **Feasibility Study Report:**
   * Compile all findings from the previous phases into a comprehensive report.
   * Include detailed analyses of technical, operational, financial, and legal feasibility.
   * Present the outcomes of the risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
   * Provide clear insights into the benefits and potential challenges associated with the myMRSM system.

**Phase 6: Presentation and Decision Making**

1. **Stakeholder Presentation:**
   * Present the feasibility study report to key stakeholders, including executives, management, and relevant team members.
   * Clearly communicate the findings, highlighting the benefits that the myMRSM system can bring to the organization.
   * Address any questions, concerns, or feedback from stakeholders.
2. **Decision Making:**
   * Based on the feasibility study report and stakeholder input, make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the development of the myMRSM system.
   * Consider the technical, operational, financial, and legal aspects, as well as the identified risks.

**Phase 7: Conclusion and Recommendations**

1. **Conclusion:**
   * Summarize the entire feasibility study process and its outcomes.
   * Provide a brief overview of the key findings, challenges, and benefits identified during the study.
2. **Recommendations:**
   * Offer clear recommendations to the stakeholders regarding the next steps.
   * If the project is deemed feasible, provide guidance on how to move forward with the development phase.
   * If there are challenges or uncertainties, suggest modifications, further assessments, or alternative approaches.

Each phase of the feasibility study is essential for ensuring the success of the myMRSM project. Thorough analysis, stakeholder engagement, and well-documented reports will provide a strong foundation for informed decision-making and effective project execution.
