5. **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
   * Conduct meetings with the risk management team to identify financial risks associated with the myMRSM project.
   * Discuss contingency plans and financial reserves to address unforeseen financial challenges.

### Operational Feasibility Site Visit Activities:

1. **Alignment with Objectives:**
   * Engage in conversations with MRSM's senior leadership to ensure that the myMRSM system aligns with the institution's educational goals and strategic plans.
   * Confirm that the project's objectives align with MRSM's mission and vision.
2. **User Acceptance Evaluation:**
   * Organize focus group sessions involving MRSM staff and students to gauge their readiness for system adoption.
   * Collect feedback on their expectations, concerns, and training needs.
3. **Workflow Impact Analysis:**
   * Observe current workflows and operational processes at MRSM to understand how the myMRSM system will integrate into daily operations.
   * Identify potential bottlenecks or areas where the system can streamline processes.
4. **Staffing and Training Assessment:**
   * Assess the availability of staff members to manage, maintain, and support the myMRSM system.
   * Review the proposed training plans and skill development initiatives for MRSM personnel responsible for the system's operation.
5. **Cultural and Organizational Fit Analysis:**
   * Conduct interviews with key stakeholders, including department heads and faculty members, to assess the organizational culture at MRSM.
   * Identify cultural factors that may impact the adoption of the myMRSM system and develop strategies to address them.

These detailed site visit activities provide a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility aspects related to the myMRSM integrated information management system. They enable MRSM stakeholders to make informed decisions and take necessary actions to ensure the successful development and implementation of the system.
